This repository provides the necessary code, documentation, and resources to reproduce the gender prediction model using the Common Voice dataset. It serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers, developers, or enthusiasts interested in leveraging voice data for gender classification tasks. The project encourages further exploration and experimentation with different neural network architectures, feature extraction techniques, and optimization strategies to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness.

# Gender_Detection_Using_Voice
This project is an implementation of a gender detection system using voice data. The goal of the project is to classify the gender of a speaker based on their voice characteristics. The system utilizes Deep Learning techniques to train a model that can accurately predict the gender of a speaker from their voice input.

# DATASET: Common Voice
General Information
Common Voice is a corpus of speech data read by users on the Common Voice website (http://voice.mozilla.org/), and based upon text from a number of public domain sources like user submitted blog posts, old books, movies, and other public speech corpora. Its primary purpose is to enable the training and testing of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems.

# Data Preprocessing:
The Common Voice dataset is preprocessed to extract the relevant voice recordings and associated gender labels. The audio files are converted into suitable numerical representations for input to the neural network model. Additionally, data cleaning and normalization techniques may be applied to enhance the quality and consistency of the dataset.

# Feature Extraction:
From the preprocessed voice recordings, various acoustic features are extracted, such as pitch, formants, spectral features, and other relevant characteristics. These features capture the unique qualities of male and female voices and provide valuable information for gender classification.

# Model Development:
A feed-forward neural network model is designed and implemented using a deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The extracted voice features serve as input to the model, which consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons. The model learns to recognize patterns and relationships between the input features and the corresponding gender labels.

# Training and Evaluation:
The preprocessed dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained using the training set, and its performance is evaluated using the testing set. Training involves optimizing the model's parameters through backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize the classification error. Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, are calculated to assess the model's effectiveness in predicting gender.

# Deployment:
Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed as a standalone system or integrated into other applications or platforms. The gender prediction system can accept voice inputs from users and provide real-time predictions of their gender. Additionally, the trained model can be saved and reused for future predictions.
